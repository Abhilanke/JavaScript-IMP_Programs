//  let b=30;
//  let c =40;


//var = variable can be re-declared 
//variable is globle scope
// var a=1;
// var a=10;


//let = variable can-not be re-declared
//let is block scoped = we declared variable within the block then variable  only use within the block
// let b=10;
// let b=1; //variable can-not be re-declared but can be update 


//const = variable can not be re-declared or updated
// a block scoped variable
//const keyword must be declartion and initialization the variable both is present
// const b = 14.3;
// const b=13.4;
// console.log(b);
